	abstract = {Generation of induced pluripotent stem cells ({iPSCs)} is a process whose mechanistic underpinnings are only beginning to emerge. Here, we applied in-depth quantitative proteomics to monitor proteome changes during the course of reprogramming of fibroblasts to {iPSCs.} We uncover a two-step resetting of the proteome during the first and last 3Â days of reprogramming, with multiple functionally related proteins changing in expression in a highly coordinated fashion. This comprised several biological processes, including changes in the stoichiometry of electron transport-chain complexes, repressed vesicle-mediated transport during the intermediate stage, and an {EMT-like} process in the late phase. In addition, we demonstrate that the nucleoporin Nup210 is essential for reprogramming by its permitting of rapid cellular proliferation and subsequent progression through {MET.} Along with the identification of proteins expressed in a stage-specific manner, this study provides a rich resource toward an enhanced mechanistic understanding of cellular reprogramming.},
